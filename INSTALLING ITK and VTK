INSTALLING ITK and VTK

This process is long.
Do it whenever you have time. you will have some 

We will try to run this example here:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/fbeeper/nifti-vtk

Install CMAKE: (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
Simply extract the file from what download. 
Double click on the .dmg file. 
Before finishing, check the option: Install Commond-Line Link
if cmake comandline tools fail, then do this:
http://cmake.3232098.n2.nabble.com/Install-Command-Line-Links-Failed-td6567624.html

then do this:
• This will a the folder VTK-IKT in your home directory:
cd && mkdir VTK-ITK && cd VTK-ITK
• This will download vtk and itk and their data 
git clone git://vtk.org/VTK.git && git clone git://vtk.org/VTKData.git
git clone git://itk.org/ITK.git && git clone git://itk.org/ITKData.git

Open Cmake:
In the top two lines, 
set Source code as  /Users/wswi/VTK-ITK/ITK
set the binaries as  /Users/wswi/VTK-ITK/ITK_bin
click configure.
(it iwll ask you to create the directory, yes)
(use default native compliers, yes)
click configure again until everything goes white (not red)
click on advanced
check build examples
check Module_ITKVtkGlue
Generate
Be careful.. it seems that cmake throws "Generating done" but is still doing things. Make sure he is done.. (check Activity monitor or something.. (can't believe what im saing... ) and then close it).
close Cmake.

Do the same for VTK:
Module_ITKVtkGlue will not be there, ok no need to check it. But check the examples ;)

After running both cmakes:
Open Xcode projects (this takes a while too, be patient .. .. .. AKSA!#!@|##¢@$!!.. yes a bit more until Xcode has done EVERYTHING!! ).
Build Xcode projects. It will take a while. again.. cut your nails.

After finishing you will find your applications here:
VTK-ITK/VTK_bin/bin
VTK-ITK/ITK_bin/bin

open then through terminal in order to see if you need to pass some arguments

If anything goes wrong you can delete the VTK_bin or ITK_bin folder and do the cmake process again. make sure you follow the steps. I had to so it twice.. it seems that xcode is hanging sometimes..
